# Pokedex
  An application that fetches data for 151 Pokémon from an API and displays their information with a nice UI.

## How does it work ? 
  The application consists of two pages: a home page and a detail page.

- The application starts with the home page. On this page, Pokémon cards are displayed in a list format.
- When one of the Pokémon is tapped, the detail page opens. This page contains detailed information about the Pokémon.
